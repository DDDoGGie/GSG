# Domain cluster

## GSG.KMeans_use

GSG.KMeans_use is a function to cluster domain using feature embedding with k-means.
The input of this function is the feature embedding saved in the anndata object returned by the GSG.GSG_train function and the number of clustering classes you want to get, the kmeans clustering method is called in the function to perform the clustering operation on the feature embedding, and the function returns the clustering result and saves it into the anndata object.
### Parameters
```
embedding: numpy.matrix
       Feature embedding 

cluster_number: int (default = 8)
             The number of domain clusters.
```

### Returns
```
pred: list
       Clustering results of the function.
```
