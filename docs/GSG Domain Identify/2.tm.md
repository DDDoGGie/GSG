# Train model

## GSG.GSG_train

GSG_train is a function to train the generative self-supervised graph learning model.

### Parameters
```
adata: anndata
       10X spatial transcriptome data.

graph: dgl object
       The neighbor structure of the graph with spatial information.

args: argparse
      The arguments of constructing graph. 
```

### Retures
```
adata: anndata
       10X spatial transcriptome data, and feature embedding is stored in adata.obsm['GSG_embedding'].

model: Generative self-supervised graph learning model.
```

### Examples
```
adata, model = GSG.GSG_train(adata, graph, args)
```
