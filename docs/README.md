# GSG

GSG: A generative self-supervised graph learning framework.

GSG, a **generative self-supervised graph learning** framework, is introduced to enable better representation learning. Integrating of spatial and gene expression information with GSG leads to more effective and comprehensive low-dimensional embedding of ST data.

This documentation is organized as followed:

- [Domain identification](https://keaml-guan.github.io/GSG/GSG%20Domain%20Identify/)
- [Trajectory inference](https://keaml-guan.github.io/GSG/GSG%20Trajectory%20Inference/)
- [Gene reconstruct](https://keaml-guan.github.io/GSG/GSG%20Gene%20Reconstruct/)
- [Batch effect](https://keaml-guan.github.io/GSG/GSG%20Batch%20effect/)
